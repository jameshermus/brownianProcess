# brownianProcess

This repository contains the code use in the writting of the paper: 

Federico Tessari, James Hermus, Rika Sugimoto-Dimitrova, and Neville Hogan, "Brownian Processes in Human Motor Tasks: Behavioral Evidence of Velocity-level Planning" Currently submitted to Science. 

## Code Organization and Data
The experimenal data file is quite large and not stored on github. Download the [BrownData](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/lbxsi4ce05hwjn6l1djhm/h?dl=0&rlkey=efdng3wizd3u652sjmlwrzglk) folder from dropbox and place it in the brownianProcess folder.

[main](https://github.com/jameshermus/brownianProcess/blob/main/main.m): This script generates the figures presented in the paper. Processing all trials, condistions, and stiffness levels takes some time.
